## Leaflet Challenge

In this file, I have pulled earthquake data from: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson

After pulling this data, I created a map showing earthquake loctions, with the size of the circle representing magnitude and the color representing depth.

Each marker has a bound popup containing information on the earthquake.

I have also included a legend for easier understanding.
